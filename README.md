# PixelPilot

## Introduction

A simple browser engine built for fun and profit.

## Motivation

I built PixelPilot because I was interested in learning more about browsers inner work.
While I don't expect it to replace existing browser engines in the market,
I hope it can serve as a learning tool for others interested in this topic.

## How to use

TODO: instructions on how to build and run.

## Future plans

I plan to continue improving it by adding support for more HTML tags and features,
and possibly exploring other aspects of browser engines such as JavaScript support and network communication.

## Contributions

I welcome contributions! If you find any bugs or have suggestions for new features,
please open an issue or a pull request on the repository.
